Purpose:

An emergency response system that automatically calls emergency services in a collision. <br/>
* This is an enhancement of the Mercedes-Benz e-Call system, known as "Collision:Recon-Analysis-SOS".
* In this prototype, the system automatically notifies emergency services after a car accident.
* As an improvement of the original model, the system automatically decides and suggests which emergency vehicles to deploy depending on the severity of the collision. It does so by collecting various data from the accident such as number of occupants, rate of deceleration, and GPS location and then comparing those with the already  existing meta data from previous cases. Doing so can speed up emergency response rapidly and increase the chance of survival for those involved.
